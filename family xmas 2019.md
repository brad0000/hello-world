## When?

- Check-in: 2pm 23rd Dec 2019
- Check-out: 10am 1st Jan 2020

## Why?

- because it's been an age and we have good reason to celebrate together

## Transport

- hayden & kat are driving down from christchurch via the west coast for 1 night, they'll have a big minivan thing
- brad & ellen are driving down on sunday the 21st and are staying that night in wanaka at the lakeside apartments, they'll have a car and a trailer and 5 bikes and 3 skateboards and possibly a bike child trailer
- ant & amy are arriving in queenstown on tuesday the 23rd and will drive a rental to wanaka

## Accomodation Costs

- brad has confirmed accomodation costs with everyone and is tracking payments received

## Food Costs

- there are a few options; 1) buy your own food and do your own thing, 2) contribute money to a marxist food kitty, 3) pay for all the ingredients for everyone on the night you cook
- when the marxist food kitty is low we'll ask for donations ("from each according to their ability")
- BYO booze, the marxist food kitty is just for shared groceries

## Meal Planning

- there's no plan for organized breakfasts & lunches, do your own thing or organize a communal thing
- we'll try to have communal dinners, not mandatory of course, but the more the merrier
- it's probably simplest for each family to take turns cooking dinner, 6 families, 9 nights, so 3 will have to go twice. Pick a recipe, consider dietary requirements, work out ingredients for 19 people, go shopping for ingredients on-the-day (we'll have limited fridge space), and rope-in some people to help
- we've pre-arranged christmas dinner, two large turkey & ham christmas food bags are being delivered to brad & ellen in wanaka on sunday the 21st (menu at https://www.myfoodbag.co.nz/christmas/ham-turkey-large)

## Secret Santa

- we should not feel obliged to buy presents for everyone
- a few people have suggested a secret santa, if people are keen brad will organize that
- the traditional thing is to draw names from a hat and each buy a $20 present for 1 other known person
- alternatively, everyone could give brad & ellen $20 and they'll buy the presents, transport them to wanaka and they'll be given out randomly in game-form
- besides the secret santa, obviously some people will give each other personal gifts, especially to the kids
